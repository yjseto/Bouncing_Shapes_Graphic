# Bouncing_Shapes_Graphic

Description: Homework question for an introductory computer science course. 
             Utilizes OpenGL and C++ to create shapes that "bounce around". 
                          
Acquired Knowledge: Learned how to use C++ with OpenGL library. 
                   Gained familiarity with OOP concepts.
                   In the future, would like to update code so shapes bounce when hitting each other rather than just the wall.
                   Would also like for the shapes to change color when they touch a shape or wall.
